Project Overview:
This project involves performing an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Swiggy's dataset to gain insights into restaurant performance, customer trends, and popular cuisines. The analysis aims to identify top revenue-generating restaurants, cities, and cuisines, along with exploring customer behavior through interactive visualizations.

Key Objectives:
Analyze city-wise and restaurant-wise revenue generation.
Identify the most visited restaurants and highest-rated ones.
Explore customer preferences for various cuisines.
Provide meaningful KPIs like total revenue, average ratings, and operational cities/restaurants.
